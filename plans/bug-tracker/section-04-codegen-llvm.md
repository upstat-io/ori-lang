## Open Bugs

- [ ] `[BUG-04-001][high]` **Cross-compilation to Windows fails: host linker used instead of cross-linker** — found by manual.
  Repro: `ori build hello.ori --target=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` on Linux host
  Error: `R_AMD64_IMAGEBASE with __ImageBase undefined` — GNU ld receives Windows COFF object
  Root cause: `LinkerFlavor::for_target()` correctly selects `Msvc`, but `LinkerDetection::is_available()` fails (no `link.exe`/`lld-link` on Linux), fallback cascades to host `cc`. Additionally, Linux-compiled `libori_rt.a` is linked with Linux system libraries (`-lgcc_s -lutil -lrt -lpthread -lm -ldl -lc`). Three issues: (1) no validation that cross-linker exists before attempting cross-compile, (2) no cross-compiled runtime for target, (3) system library selection ignores target OS.
  Subsystem: `compiler/ori_llvm/src/aot/linker/driver.rs`, `mod.rs` (fallback logic), `gcc.rs` (system libs)
  Found: 2026-03-28 | Source: manual
  Note: Also applies to `--target=x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` (needs `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc`).
